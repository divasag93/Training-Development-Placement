        Your decision to structure your career in Engg. / Pharmacy/ Computer 
        Application/ Management at SRMS Institutions is highly commendable and I, on 
        behalf of SRMS Trust family extend a very warm welcome to you all. We have

        it for you . What you do today will determine your tomorrow , Recollect what 
        Swami Vivekanand has opined “You have to grow from the inside out; no one can 
        teach you , no one can make you spiritual. There is no other teacher but your 
        own soul”. Work and live as a family unit is the philosophy of SRMS Institutions 
        and I hope that your stay with us will be very comfortable, fruitful and
